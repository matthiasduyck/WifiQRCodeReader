WiFi QR Code Scanner allows you to scan a WiFi QR Code using your webcam and instantly connect to that network. Simply hold a WiFi QR Code up to your webcam and click connect when scanned. Once scanned, the network will be saved for later re-connection.

These QR codes are often provided by your ISP or in public settings that offer WiFi. Android and iPhone devices have this scanning and connecting feature built-in. You can also generate such a QR code yourself, with freely available online tools, simply look for 'Generate WiFi QR code'. Combined with this tool, you can easily share your WiFi connection with others and/or change your password frequently without the hassle of typing over the password.

Usage notes:
For the connection to work, you need to be close enough that your device can see the network to connect to.
If scanning from another display (such as a smartphone), you may need to adjust the brightness down for the code to be recognized.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
This app is still in an early development stage and may contain bugs. Testing only occurred on x86 devices with a single webcam/camera and single WiFi card.
