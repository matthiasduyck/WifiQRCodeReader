WiFi QR Code Scanner PRO is the PRO version of the WiFi QR Code Scanner app that allows you to scan and generate standard WiFi QR Codes.

WARNING: Currently the PRO version will receive new functions and features first or may contain some exclusive features. This distinction is subject to change. The PRO version will always be free from any advertisements or other monetizations.

Scan using your webcam and instantly connect to that network. Simply hold a WiFi QR Code up to your webcam and click connect when scanned. Once scanned, the network will be saved by Windows for later re-connection.

These QR codes are often provided by your ISP or in public settings that offer WiFi. You can also generate a WiFi QR code using the 'Create QR Code' tab. For both scanning and generating, we use the de facto standard used by many other apps and platforms. This means you can use QR codes generated by other tools (such as https://qifi.org/) to scan, or use generated codes in the app on other platforms, such as iOS and Android.

Using this app, you can easily share your WiFi connection with others and/or change your password frequently without the hassle of typing over the password every time. This can thus provide both convenience and strong security when using complex passwords.

Usage notes:
- For the connection functionality to work, you need to be close enough that your device can see the network to connect to. If you can see your network in the network list of Windows, you should be able to connect.

- If scanning from another display (such as a smartphone), you may need to adjust the brightness down for the code to be recognized.

- Make sure to fill the preview screen with the code.
